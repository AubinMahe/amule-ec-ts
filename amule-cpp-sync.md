# `C++ amule` vs `amule-ec-ts`

## Role of this file

List of differences to analyze point by point, on every fetch/pull.

Points recorded here must be sorted into TODO.md, ISSUES.md, or CHOICES.md.

## Method

Mechanical diff of the `EC_OP_*`/`EC_TAG_*` enums (generated C++ vs `ECOpcode.ts`/ `ECTagNames.ts`) for pure novelties, then
commit-by-commit review (the actual diff, not just the message) for behavior changes on protocol already ported.

## 2026-08-15

Reviewed every commit (~90) touching the EC protocol in the local C++ repo (`/home/aubin/Dev/git/amule`, up-to-date clone of the
official repo, rebuilt regularly) since 2026-06-04, to detect drift between the actual protocol and what `amule-ec-ts` ports.
